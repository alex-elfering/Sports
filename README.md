Contains code, dashboards, and visualizations visualizing topics around various sports, though mostly covering College Football.

##  Projects
**College Football Games Won Every 5 Seasons**: Tracks games won by each college football team based on conference or whether it was a close game or a blowout. The data was scrapped and cleaned in R and visualized in a Tableau Dashboard.

**College Football ELO Ratings Model**: Inspired by FiveThirtyEight. Created ELO ratings for College Football teams going back to 1869 to visualize how teams have changed over time, and also to predict future games.

**College Football Schedule Scrapping**: Scrapes College Football games and conferences for use in ELO model.

**College Football ELO Rankings**: Using my ELO ratings, I created several visualizations examining which teams are in the top 25, or which teams are improving the most or becoming worse. The output are several tables that can be updated throughout the season.

**College Football Bowl Predictions**: Using ELO ratings to predict which teams have the best chance of winning enough games to qualify for the post-season, as well as the chance of each team winning a certain number of games.
